# DifferNet (Zerobox Version)

This is the official repository to the WACV 2021 paper "[Same Same But DifferNet: Semi-Supervised Defect Detection with Normalizing Flows](
https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12577)" by Marco Rudolph, Bastian Wandt and Bodo Rosenhahn.

If the only reason you ended up here is because you made a typo on 'different' - what was our intention - here is a shortened summary: We introduce a method that is able to find anomalies like defects on image data without having some of them in the training set.

## Getting Started

You will need [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads) and the packages specified in _requirements.txt_.
We recommend setting up a [virtual environment with pip](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
and installing the packages there.

Install packages with:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configure and Run

All configurations concerning data, model, training, visualization etc. can be made in _config.py_. The default configuration will run a training with paper-given parameters on the provided dummy dataset. This dataset contains images of 4 squares as normal examples and 4 circles as anomaly.

To start the training, just run _main.py_! If training on the dummy data does not lead to an AUROC of 1.0, something seems to be wrong.
Please report us if you have issues when using the code.

## Data

The given dummy dataset shows how the implementation expects the construction of a dataset. Coincidentally, the [MVTec AD dataset](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad) is constructed in this way.

Set the variables _dataset_path_ and _class_name_ in _config.py_ to run experiments on a dataset of your choice. The expected structure of the data is as follows:

``` 
train data:

        dataset_path/class_name/train/good/any_filename.png
        dataset_path/class_name/train/good/another_filename.tif
        dataset_path/class_name/train/good/xyz.png
        [...]

test data:

    'normal data' = non-anomalies

        dataset_path/class_name/test/good/just_dont_use_windows_for_this.png
        [...]

    anomalies - assume there are anomaly classes 'crack' and 'curved'

Some code of the [FrEIA framework](https://github.com/VLL-HD/FrEIA) was used for the implementation of Normalizing Flows. Follow [their tutorial](https://github.com/VLL-HD/FrEIA) if you need more documentation about it.
